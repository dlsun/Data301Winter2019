    "The Department of Developmental Services (DDS) in California is responsible for allocating funds to support over 250,000 developmentally-disabled residents. The data set `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dlsun/data-science-book/master/data/ca_dds_expenditures.csv` contains data about 1,000 of these residents. The data comes from a discrimination lawsuit which alleged that California's Department of Developmental Services (DDS) privileged white (non-Hispanic) residents over Hispanic residents in allocating funds. We will focus on comparing the allocation of funds (i.e., expenditures) for these two ethnicities only, although there are other ethnicities in this data set.\n",

    "- Id:  5-digit, unique identification code for each consumer (similar to a social security number and used for identification purposes)  \n",
    "- Age Cohort:  Binned age variable represented as six age cohorts (0-5, 6-12, 13-17, 18-21, 22-50, and 51+)\n",
    "- Age:  Unbinned age variable\n",
    "- Gender:  Male or Female\n",
    "- Expenditures:  Dollar amount of annual expenditures spent on each consumer\n",
    "- Ethnicity:  Eight ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Multi-race, Native Hawaiian, Other, and White non-Hispanic)"
