    "# Authorship of the Federalist Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Federalist Papers_ were a set of 85 essays published between 1787 and 1788 to promote the ratification of the United States Constitution. They were originally published under the pseudonym \"Publius\". Although the identity of the authors was a closely guarded secret at the time, most of the papers have since been conclusively attributed to one of Hamilton, Jay, or Madison. The known authorships can be found in `/data301/data/federalist/authorship.csv`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For 15 of the papers, however, the authorships remain disputed. (These papers can be identified from the `authorship.csv` file because the \"Author\" field is blank.) In this analysis, you will train a classifier on the papers with known authorships and use your classifier to predict the authorships of the disputed papers. The text of each paper can be found in the `/data301/data/federalist/` directory. The name of the file indicates the number of the paper."

    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing an author's style, common words like \"the\" and \"on\" are actually more useful than rare words like \"hostilities\". That is because rare words typically signify context. Context is useful if you are trying to find documents about similar topics, but not so useful if you are trying to identify an author's style because different authors can write about the same topic. For example, both Dr. Seuss and Charles Dickens used rare words like \"chimney\" and \"stockings\" in _How the Grinch Stole Christmas_ and _A Christmas Carol_, respectively. But they used common words very differently: Dickens used the word \"upon\" over 100 times, while Dr. Seuss did not use \"upon\" at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read in the Federalist Papers. Convert each one into a vector of term frequencies. In order to restrict to common words, include only the top 50 words. Then, train a $k$-nearest neighbors model on the documents with known authorship. Determine an optimal value of $k$ (it's up to you to decide what's \"optimal\"). \n",
