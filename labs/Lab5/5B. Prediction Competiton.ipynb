The top 5 people will earn up to 5 bonus points on this lab. To join the competition, visit [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/beer2019). You will need to create an account on Kaggle first."

At least one of your models must contain variables derived from the `description` of each beer. Use cross-validation to systematically select good models and submit your predictions to Kaggle. You are allowed 2 submissions per day, so submit early and often!\n",
