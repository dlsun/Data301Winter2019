    "## Grammar of Graphics\n",
    "\n",
    "The **grammar of graphics** organizes the ideas above into a coherent philosophy. The key insight is that a graphic can be specified by mapping its \"aesthetics\" (e.g., color, size, $x$-axis, column facet) to variables in a data set. Although `pandas` provides some support for this philosophy (as we have seen above), the process is tedious and often requires writing boilerplate code. For example, in order to use color to represent building type, we had to manually map each building type to a color. Libraries based on the grammar of graphics provide a more friendly interface and hide this complexity from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "Software packages that implement the grammar of graphics include `ggplot2` in R and [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) in Python. Since we are working in Python, we will use Altair. The first step is to import the package."
