    "Prediction problems are ubiquitous in real world applications. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A real estate agent might want to predict the fair price of a home, using features of the home.\n",
    "- A sports bettor might want to predict which team will win the game, using information about the teams.\n",
    "- A historian might want to predict which historical figure wrote an anonymous document, using the words in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each case, we have two kinds of variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **features** (a.k.a. **predictors**, **inputs**, **independent variables**), such as square footage and number of bedrooms, that are used to predict \n",
    "- a **label** (a.k.a. **response**, **output**, **dependent variable**), such as house price. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can formalize the problem mathematically as follows: let ${\\bf x}$ be the features and $y$ the label; a **predictive model** is a function $f$ that maps ${\\bf x}$ to $y$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f: {\\bf x} \\mapsto y. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now suppose we have a new house, with features ${\\bf x}^*$. A predictive model $f$ predicts the price of this house to be $f({\\bf x}^*)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we come up a predictive model $f$ in the first place? One way is to learn it from existing data, or **training data**. For example, to build a model that predicts the price of a home from the square footage (`Gr Liv Area`), we would need training data like the points shown in black below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"predictive_model.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "We could then learn a model, $f$, from this training data. For example, one possible predictive model is the red curve shown in the plot. This model was chosen to fit the points in the training data as tightly as possible. If we wanted to predict the price of a 2700 square foot home using this model, we would simply evaluate $f(2700)$, which comes out to about \\\\$300,000. The key thing to note is that $f$ depends on the training data. If the training data changes, then so does $f$."

In this chapter, we will focus on one machine learning algorithm called **k-nearest neighbors** that leverages the distance metrics that you learned about in Chapter 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictive models are divided into two types, depending on whether the label $y$ is categorical or quantitative. If the label is quantitative, then the prediction problem is a **regression** problem, and the model is called a **regressor**. If the label is categorical, then the prediction problem is a **classification** problem, and the model is called a **classifier**.
