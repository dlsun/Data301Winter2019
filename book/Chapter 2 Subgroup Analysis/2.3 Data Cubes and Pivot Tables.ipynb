Each row represents an observation (i.e., a distinct combination of sex, adult, and class) and each column a variable (i.e., the proportion of passengers who survived). Another way to represent these results is using a **data cube**. In a data cube, the possible values of each dimension are laid out along one dimension of a cube, as shown below:\n",

First, as we can plainly see in the figure above, the dimensions need not all be the same size; some dimensions may have more values than others. Second, a data cube can have any number of dimensions, so it does not have to be three-dimensional. A data cube with $d$ dimensions is really a $d$-dimensional hypercube. A 2-dimensional hypercube is a square (or rectangle), a 1-dimensional hypercube is a line, and a 0-dimensional hypercube is a point.\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is useful to imagine a data cube as a $d$-dimensional hypercube, it is not practical to display data in a hypercube---at least not when $d > 2$. So a data cube is often printed as a two-dimensional table, with multi-level row indexes and columns to represent the dimensions. This two-dimensional representation of the data cube is called a **pivot table**. Here is the code to produce a pivot table from the raw data:"
