    "You may not be used to thinking about _text_, like an e-mail or a newspaper article, as data. But just as we might want to predict the price of a home or group wines into similar types, we might want to predict the sender of an e-mail or group articles into similar types. To leverage the machine learning techniques we have already learned, we will need a way to convert raw text into tabular form. This chapter introduces some principles for doing this."

That is, it will detect any occurrence of punctuation. We will then use the `.str.replace()` method to replace all detected occurrences with the empty string, effectively removing all punctuation from the string.\n",
